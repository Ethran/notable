## About This Fork
This project began as a fork of the original Notable app and has since evolved into a continuation of it. The architecture is largely the same, but many of the functions have been rewritten and expanded with a focus on practical, everyday use. Development is active when possible, guided by the principle that the app must be fast and dependable ‚Äî performance comes first, and the basics need to feel right before new features are introduced. Waiting for things to load is seen as unacceptable, so responsiveness is a core priority.

The stance on AI is simple: no reliance on cloud integrations. The preference is for solutions that run entirely on the device, with the long-term goal of enabling local handwriting-to-LaTeX conversion (or at least to plain text).

---

## Features
* ‚ö° **Fast page turns with caching:** smooth, swift page transitions, including quick navigation to the next and previous pages.
* ‚ÜïÔ∏è **Infinite vertical scroll:** a virtually endless canvas for notes with smooth vertical scrolling.
* üìù **Quick Pages:** instantly create a new page.
* üìí **Notebooks:** group related notes and switch easily between notebooks.
* üìÅ **Folders:** organize notes with folders.
* ü§è **Editor mode gestures:** [intuitive gesture controls](#gestures) to enhance editing.
* üåÖ **Images:** add, move, scale, and remove images.
* ‚û§ **Selection export:** export or share selected handwriting as PNG.
* ‚úèÔ∏è **Scribble to erase:** erase content by scribbling over it (disabled by default) ‚Äî contributed by [@niknal357](https://github.com/niknal357).
* üîÑ **Auto-refresh on background change:** useful when using a tablet as a second display ‚Äî see [Working with LaTeX](#working-with-latex).

---

## Download
**Download the latest stable version of the [Notable app here.](https://github.com/Ethran/notable/releases/latest)**

Alternatively, get the latest build from the main branch via the ["next" release](https://github.com/Ethran/notable/releases/next).

Open the **Assets** section of the release and select the `.apk` file.

<details><summary title="Click to show/hide details">‚ùì Where can I see alternative/older releases?</summary><br/>
You can go to the original olup <a href="https://github.com/olup/notable/tags" target="_blank">Releases</a> and download alternative versions of the Notable app.
</details>

<details><summary title="Click to show/hide details">‚ùì What is a 'next' release?</summary><br/>
The "next" release is a pre-release and may contain features implemented but not yet released as part of a stable version ‚Äî and sometimes experiments that may not make it into a release.
</details>

---

## Gestures
Notable features intuitive gesture controls within Editor mode to optimize the editing experience:

#### ‚òùÔ∏è 1 Finger
* **Swipe up or down:** scroll the page.
* **Swipe left or right:** change to the previous/next page (only available in notebooks).
* **Double tap:** undo.
* **Hold and drag:** select text and images.

#### ‚úåÔ∏è 2 Fingers
* **Swipe left or right:** show or hide the toolbar.
* **Single tap:** switch between writing and eraser modes.
* **Pinch:** zoom in and out.
* **Hold and drag:** move the canvas.

#### üî≤ Selection
* **Drag:** move the selection.
* **Double tap:** copy the selected writing.

---

## System Requirements and Permissions

* **Android version**: Requires Android 10 (SDK 29) or higher. Limited support for Android 9 (SDK 28) may be possible if [issue #93](https://github.com/Ethran/notable/issues/93) is resolved.
* **Device support**: Optimized for Onyx BOOX devices. Handwriting features are currently not available on non-Onyx devices, though future support may be possible.
* **Permissions and storage**: Storage access is needed to manage notes, assets, and PDF backgrounds (which require ‚Äúall files access‚Äù). The database is stored in `Documents/natabledb` for easy backup and safer handling, while exports are saved in `Documents/natable`.


---

## Export and Import

- Selection export: export or share selected handwriting as PNG.
- PDF:
  - Import PDFs and optionally observe them for live refresh (see [Working with LaTeX](#working-with-latex)).
- Xournal++:
  - XOPP export for [Xournal++](https://xournalpp.github.io/) ‚Äî partial support.  
    Files opened and saved by Xournal++ may lose some stroke data. Background information is not exported correctly.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Bookmarks support, tags, and internal links ‚Äî [issue #52](https://github.com/Ethran/notable/issues/52) ‚Äî long-term  
  - [ ] Export links to PDF ‚Äî long-term

- [ ] PDF annotation and other PDF-related improvements
  - [x] Basic support
  - [ ] Show annotations from other programs
  - [ ] Allow saving annotations to the original PDF file
  - [ ] Migrate to a dedicated PDF library (replacing the default Android renderer)

- [ ] Figure and text recognition ‚Äî [issue #44](https://github.com/Ethran/notable/issues/44)  
  - [ ] Searchable notes ‚Äî long-term  
  - [ ] Automatic creation of tag descriptions ‚Äî long-term  
  - [ ] Shape recognition ‚Äî long-term

- [ ] Better selection tools  
  - [ ] Stroke editing: color, size, etc.  
  - [ ] Rotate  
  - [ ] Flip selection  
  - [ ] Auto-scroll when dragging selection to screen edges  
  - [ ] Easier selection movement (e.g., dragging to scroll page)

- [x] More dynamic page and notebook movement. Previously, pages could only be moved left/right ‚Äî drag-and-drop support added.

- [x] Page can be moved horizontally ‚Äî makes it easier to write in the margins.

- [x] Better notebook covers, with default title-page styles.

- [!] Custom drawing tools: not possible.

---

## Known Limitations

- Custom drawing tools are not supported because the Onyx E‚ÄëInk library does not support them, and its documentation is limited.
- Non-Onyx devices currently lack handwriting support.
- Some advanced Onyx-specific features depend on vendor libraries and may not behave consistently across firmware versions.

---

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

**What are ‚ÄúNeoTools,‚Äù and why are some disabled?**
NeoTools are components of the Onyx E-Ink toolset, made available through Onyx‚Äôs libraries. However, certain tools are unstable and can cause crashes, so they are disabled by default to ensure better app stability. Examples include:

* `com.onyx.android.sdk.pen.NeoCharcoalPenV2`
* `com.onyx.android.sdk.pen.NeoMarkerPen`
* `com.onyx.android.sdk.pen.NeoBrushPen`

## Working with LaTeX

The app can be used as a **primitive second monitor** for LaTeX editing ‚Äî previewing compiled PDFs
in real time on your tablet.

### Steps:

- Connect your device to your computer via USB (MTP).
- Set up automatic copying of the compiled PDF to the tablet:
  <details>
  <summary>Example using a custom <code>latexmkrc</code>:</summary>

  ```perl
  $pdf_mode = 1;
  $out_dir = 'build';

  sub postprocess {
      system("cp build/main.pdf '/run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp:host=DEVICE/Internal shared storage/Documents/Filename.pdf'");
  }

  END {
      postprocess();
  }
  ```

  </details>
- Compile, and test if it copies the file to the tablet.
- Import your compiled PDF document into Notable, and choose to observe the PDF file.

> After each recompilation, Notable will detect the updated PDF and automatically refresh the view.

---

## App Distribution

- **Not available** on Google Play or F-Droid.
- Official builds are provided only via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Ethran/notable/releases).

### Project structure and docs
- Project structure: [docs/file-structure.md](./docs/file-structure.md)  
- Database structure and stroke encoding specification: [docs/database-structure.md](./docs/database-structure.md)  
  Note: This documents ware AI-generated and lightly verified; refer to the code for the authoritative source.

### Development Notes

- Edit the `DEBUG_STORE_FILE` in `/app/gradle.properties` to point to your local keystore file. This is typically located in the `.android` directory.
- To debug on a BOOX device, enable developer mode. You can follow [this guide](https://imgur.com/a/i1kb2UQ).
