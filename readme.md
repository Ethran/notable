## Working with LaTeX

The app can be used as a **primitive second monitor** for LaTeX editing ‚Äî previewing compiled PDFs
in real time on your tablet.

### Steps:

- Connect your device to your computer via USB (MTP).
- Set up automatic copying of the compiled PDF to the tablet:
  <details>
  <summary>Example using a custom <code>latexmkrc</code>:</summary>

  ```perl
  $pdf_mode = 1;
  $out_dir = 'build';

  sub postprocess {
      system("cp build/main.pdf '/run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp:host=DEVICE/Internal shared storage/Documents/Filename.pdf'");
  }

  END {
      postprocess();
  }
  ```

  </details>
- Compile, and test if it copies the file to the tablet.
- Import your compiled PDF document into Notable, and choose to observe the PDF file.

> After each recompilation, Notable will detect the updated PDF and automatically refresh the view.

## Contribute

Notable is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome. If you'd like to get started, please refer to [GitHub's contributing guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

### Project structure
Project structure can be found [here](./docs/file-structure.md).

### Development Notes

- Edit the `DEBUG_STORE_FILE` in `/app/gradle.properties` to point to your local keystore file. This is typically located in the `.android` directory.
- To debug on a BOOX device, enable developer mode. You can follow [this guide](https://imgur.com/a/i1kb2UQ).

Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. I appreciate your help!
